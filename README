hla-vagrant
===========

 Vagrant+SaltStack environment for development and testing


Dependencies
------------

 This repository contains files for setting up an environment for development
 and testing of the lnls-fac high level applications. To use it, you need to
 have Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and VirtualBox
 (https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. In case you do not have them
 installed, download and follow the instructions from the links.


Configuration
-------------

 When using the environment in a shared computer, change the IP addresses
 before creating the virtual machines. For that, change the value of ip in
 master_config.vm.network for all machines in Vagrantfile; change the master's
 IP address in all machine files except master in hla/etc. The IP address must
 also be changed in the *-bashrc files in hla/salt/files.


Choosing the lnls-fac package versions
--------------------------------------

 The versions of the lnls-fac packages to be used are set in the file
 hla/pillar/versions.sls. To use different versions, simply change the values
 to other valid repository release tags.


Usage
-----

 To set up the environment, download or clone this repository with

     git clone https://github.com/lnls-fac/hla-vagrant.git

 Then cd into the directory with

     cd hla-vagrant

 and issue

     vagrant up

 On the first run, it may take long for the virtual machines to be set up.
 After the machines have been started, ssh into master with

     vagrant ssh master

 and apply the state by issuing

     sudo salt '*' state.apply

 It may also take long the first time the state is applied, as many packages
 need to be downloaded and installed. The hla virtual machine needs rebooting
 after the first state application.

 To ssh as user fac, use one of the following (the default fac user password is
 fac123; remember to change it on first login):

     vagrant ssh va -- -l fac
     vagrant ssh hla -- -l fac -X

 To change the repository versions, set values in hla/salt/pillar/versions.sls
 and apply the states from the master virtual machine with

     sudo salt '*' state.apply repos.fac
     sudo salt 'va' state.apply repos.va
     sudo salt 'hla' state.apply repos.hla
