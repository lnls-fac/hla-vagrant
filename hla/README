===========

 Vagrant+SaltStack environment for development and testing


Dependencies
------------

 This repository contains files for setting up an environment for development
 and testing of the lnls-fac high level applications. To use it, you need to
 have Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and VirtualBox
 (https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. In case you do not have them
 installed, download and follow the instructions from the links.


Configuration
-------------

 When using the environment in a shared computer, change the IP addresses
 before creating the virtual machines. For that, change the value of ip in
 master_config.vm.network for all machines in Vagrantfile. You also need to
 change the master's IP address in all machine files except master in etc.


Choosing the lnls-fac package versions
--------------------------------------

 The versions of the lnls-fac packages to be used are set in the file
 pillar/versions.sls. To use different versions, simply change the values to
 other valid repository release tags.


Usage
-----

 To set up the environment, download or clone this repository with

     git clone https://github.com/lnls-fac/hla-vagrant.git

 Then cd into the directory with

     cd hla-vagrant

 and issue

     vagrant up

 On the first run, it may take quite long for the virtual machines to be set
 up. After the machines have been started, ssh into master with

     vagrant ssh master

 and apply the state by issuing

     sudo salt '*' state.apply

 It may also take a quite long time the first time the state is applies, as
 many packages need to be downloaded and installed.
